# Calculator

This project is in the process of being refurbished, so it's not working at the moment.

This program uses a hierarchy of state graphs to emulate a calculator. More examples are given.

Use the node start.js command to run

uses node 12 and ES5 syntax

what it does do?
runs through the states in preorder traversal using a linked list
prints state sequence through the hierarchy
quits when the machine can't continue

Upgrade plan from the up to date version using Redux

what am I keeping in this version?
ES5 syntax
linked list based hierarchy tracking(to keep the logic iterative)

what am I not adding from the Redux version?
before and after var changes tracking system
hierarchical state sequence tracking
