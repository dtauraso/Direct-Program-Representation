timelines for next states

		count: 3
		parentIsAlsoParentInStateChart: false,
		timelineWeAreIntrudingOn: correctTimelineParentName
	}
}

edges
{edgeName: "next state name",
isFromCorrecttimeline: 0}

is the parent a parent of the state in the state chart?
stateChart["next state name"]["parents"][parent] === undefined


how to we find out what timeline and what state to rerun
in the editor provide the timeline tree for all visible timelines
	if the user wants to connect to a state in a different timeline they have to click on the state
	nearest answestor algorithm is now only considering the number of visible timelines
O(# of timelines the user is paying attention to)

edge (stateName, if the timeline of that state is different from this one then timelineName)
edges: [edge]



parentTree = {
	'bottom': {
		parent12: {'edges': [a, state1, c]]
		parent2: {'different timeline': {state1: parent12}, 'edges': [state1, state2], 'winning states': [state1, state2], 'indents': 0},
	}
	'graph': {
		parent3: {nextParent: null, prevParentCount: 2, ithChild: 3},
		parent2: {nextParent: parent3, prevParentCount: 1, ithChild: 1},
		parent12: {nextParent: parent3, prevParentCount: 1, ithChild: 1}
	}

}
The timeline is the one currently in use from the current state
	the current state can have several timeilines connecting to it but each one will run separately
what if the timeline attribute is true for each node in the path?
is the data from the 'bottom' just being lifted from the graph? if so then the data there is temporary


No threshold becuase the same incomming edge can get run over and over again without all the incomming edges getting run
at least 1 time.
each state that can only run after the incomming edges get run once
	store the incoming state names so we can check if all incoming edges have been run 1 time
